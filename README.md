1.The relationship between car features (e.g., manufacturing year, engine capacity, transmission type) and their prices.
2.The impact of factors like kilometers driven, ownership, and imperfections on car prices.
3.Identifying trends and patterns in the used car market to help buyers and sellers make informed decisions.
