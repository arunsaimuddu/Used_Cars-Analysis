# Used_Cars-Analysis
## Project Objective 
The objective of this project is to analyze a dataset of used cars to derive meaningful insights about pricing trends, car features, and market preferences. Using MySQL, the analysis focuses on understanding:
1.The relationship between car features (e.g., manufacturing year, engine capacity, transmission type) and their prices.

2.The impact of factors like kilometers driven, ownership, and imperfections on car prices.

3.Identifying trends and patterns in the used car market to help buyers and sellers make informed decisions.

## Dataset used 
- <a href ="https://github.com/arunsaimuddu/Used_Cars-Analysis/blob/main/cars24data.csv">Data set</a>

## Questions (KPIs)
1. calculate the average price of the cars each model and manufactured year
2. identify most common fuel type
3. count of cars based on ModelName
4. Price comaprisons based on Transmission , Engine capacity and  owners
5.  Filtering based on spare key, Imperfections, Repainted parts
6.  Trend analysis
7.  key segement from the data

## Project conclusions 
1.Pricing Factors: The price of used cars is influenced by manufacturing year, engine capacity, transmission type, and kilometers driven. Newer cars, automatic transmissions, and larger engines command higher prices.

2.Market Preferences: Buyers prefer cars with fewer imperfections, lower kilometers driven, and first ownership. These cars are priced higher in the market.

3.Fuel Type: Petrol cars dominate the market, but diesel cars are priced higher on average, likely due to their fuel efficiency and durability.

4.Repainting and Imperfections: Cars with repainted parts or imperfections are priced lower, indicating that buyers value cars in original condition.

5.Spare Key Availability: Cars with spare keys are priced slightly higher, suggesting that small conveniences can impact pricing.

## Recommendations
For Buyers: Focus on cars with lower kilometers driven, first ownership, and no imperfections for better value.

For Sellers: Highlight features like spare keys, low kilometers, and no imperfections to justify higher prices.

For Dealers: Stock more automatic and diesel cars, as they tend to sell at higher prices.
